## Sentry

**This adapter uses Sentry libraries to automatically report exceptions and code errors to the developers.** For more details and for information how to disable the error reporting see [Sentry-Plugin Documentation](https://github.com/ioBroker/plugin-sentry#plugin-sentry)! Sentry reporting is used starting with js-controller 3.0.

## Device-Watcher adapter for ioBroker

This is a watchdog for devices. The adapter looks for the different information about the datapoints and create JSON & HTML lists of them:

-   devices with battery,
-   devices with low battery,
-   devices with link quality,
-   updates for devices,
-   devices offline and
-   all devices

It's also counting them in the same categories. You can use the lists and states for Grafana, Jarvis etc for example.

A list with more information about the supported adapters can be found here: [in German](docs/de/listSupportAdapter.md) or [in English](docs/en/listSupportAdapter.md).</br>
**If one adapter is missing, feel free to open an request [issue](https://github.com/ciddi89/ioBroker.device-watcher/issues/new/choose) to add it.**

### Notifications:

The adapter has different possibilities to send notifications:

-   A device is no longer reachable or reachable again
-   A device has reached the low battery level or the low bat state is true
-   When an update is available for a device (shelly and unifi)
-   Time based a list of offline devices
-   Time based a list of low batterie devices
-   Time based a list of devices which can be updated

### Currently supported notification services are:

-   Telegram
-   Pushover
-   WhatsApp
-   Email
-   Jarvis
-   Lovelace
-   SynoChat
-   and also an datapoint with the last notification, so you can use it for other services which aren't supported.

### Blacklist

Is it neccessary to ignore a specifice device, you can add it in the blacklist and the device-watcher will ignore it.
It's possible to select:

-   Ignore in notifications
-   Ignore in main list
-   Ignore in adapter own list

### Here are some images how the lists can be look like in Grafana:
