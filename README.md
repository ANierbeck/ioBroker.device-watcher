## Device-Watcher adapter for ioBroker

This is a watchdog for devices. The adapter looks for the rssi/link quality and battery states and create JSON & HTML lists of them (devices with battery, devices with low battery, devices with link quality, devices offline and devices all) and count the devices in the same categories. For example you can use the lists and states for Grafana, Jarvis etc.

**Supported adapters:**

| - Alexa2<br>- Ble<br>- Deconz<br>- Enocean<br>- ESPHome<br>- FritzDect<br>- HAM<br>- Harmony<br>- HmiP<br>- Homematic<br>- HS100<br>- Hue<br>- Hue Extended<br>- Jeelink | - Lupusec<br>- MaxCube<br>- Meross<br>- MiHome<br>- MiHome Vacuum<br>- Netatmo<br>- Nuki Extended<br>- NUT<br>- Ping<br>- Roomba<br>- Shelly<br>- Sonoff<br>- Sonos<br>- Switchbot Ble | - Tado<br>- Tradfri<br>- Unifi<br>- WLED<br>- Yeelight<br>- Zigbee<br>- Zigbee2MQTT<br>- Zwave |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

**If one adapter is missing, feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/ciddi89/ioBroker.device-watcher/issues/new/choose) with request to add it.**

The adapter has also the option to send notifications if the number of offline devices are changed and to send you a notification if devices has a low battery state (e.g. 30%). You can choose the value for the battery notification and on which days you want the notification for low batteries.

Currently supported notification services are:

-   Telegram (with support of Chat-ID for groupchats)
-   Pushover
-   WhatsApp
-   Email
-   Jarvis
-   Lovelace
-   SynoChat
-   and also an datapoint with the last notification, so you can use it for other services which aren't supported.

If you found a bug or you have an improvement suggestion, feel free to open an issue.

### Blacklist

If you don't want a specifice device in the list, you can add it in the blacklist and the adapter will ignore it.
