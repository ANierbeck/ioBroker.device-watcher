## Sentry
**This adapter uses Sentry libraries to automatically report exceptions and code errors to the developers.** For more details and for information how to disable the error reporting see [Sentry-Plugin Documentation](https://github.com/ioBroker/plugin-sentry#plugin-sentry)! Sentry reporting is used starting with js-controller 3.0.

## Device-Watcher adapter for ioBroker

This is a watchdog for wireless devices. The adapter looks every fifteen minutes for the rssi/link quality and battery states and create JSON lists of them (devices with battery, devices with link quality, devices offline and devices all) and count the devices in the same categories. For example you can use the lists and states for Grafana, Jarvis etc.

Supported adapters are:
* Alexa2
* Ble
* Deconz
* Enocean
* ESPHome
* FritzDect
* Harmony
* Homematic
* Hue
* Hue Extended
* Jeelink
* MiHome
* MiHome Vacuum
* Nuki Extended
* Ping (You have to set the option 'Advanced Information / Erweiterte Information' in the instance settings of ping for     each device)
* Shelly
* Sonoff
* Sonos
* Switchbot Ble
* Zigbee
* Zwave

The adapter has also the option to send notifications if the number of offline devices are changed and to send you a notification if devices has a low battery state (e.g. 30%). You can choose the value for the battery notification and on which days you want the notification for low batteries. 

Currently supported notification services are: 
* Telegram (with support of Chat-ID for groupchats)
* Pushover
* WhatsApp
* Email
* Jarvis
* Lovelace
* and also an datapoint with the last notification, so you can use it for other services which aren't supported.

If you found a bug or you have an improvement suggestion, feel free to open an issue.

### Blacklist

 If you don't want a specifice device in the list, you can add it in the blacklist and the adapter will ignore it. Please add the "link_quality" or "rssi" object of this device in the blacklist and it won't be listet and count.
